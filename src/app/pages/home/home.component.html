    <h1>Welcome to My Code Portfolio!</h1>

    <p>
        Everything on this site was coded from the ground up to showcase my abilities.
        <br><br>I enjoy exploring the endless possibilites of creating visually appealing (gradients, animations, etc.) and interactive (hover, click, etc.) sites.
        <br><br>One thing to note in particular is that I tried to keep this compatible for most screens. I've accounted for widths between 320px - 1366px.

        <br><br>If you're curious about the source code, you can visit my
        <a href="https://github.com/AznChik/aznchik.github.io" target="_blank">github repository</a>
        to gain an understanding of my coding practices / organization.

        <br><br>Now, with all that out of the way, feel free to venture through my
        <button (click)="toggleSamples('open')">sample work</button> & learn <a routerLink="/about-me">about me</a>!
    </p>

        <div>
            <a routerLink="/novel-app">Novel App</a>
            <p>
                This is my most recent sample work! This app's main purpose is to test my abilities in creating an interactive novel.
                It also serves as homage to Scott Cawthon, mastermind behind the FNAF (Five Nights at Freddy's) franchise.

        <div>
            <a routerLink="/music-app">Music App</a>
            <p>
                This is my second sample work! This app's main purpose is to create an "online shopping experience":
                sorting items, adding / removing cart items, increasing / decreasing cart item quantity, etc.

                <br><br>If you already visited my <a id="about" routerLink="/about-me">about me</a> page,
                you may have concluded I enjoy referencing shows, movies, songs, etc.
                You can expect a lot more of that in this app; you have now officially been warned. Enjoy!

        <div>
            <a routerLink="/weather-app">Weather App</a>
            <p>
                This is my first complete sample work! This app's main purpose is to display my form capabilities: field validation & error handling.

                <br><br><span>NOTE:</span> The street input is the only field that affects the resulting forecast.
                If it contains a season, the forecast will reflect that season. Otherwise, the forecast will reflect a random season.
                For a full breakdown, select the info button that appears in the upper-left corner of this app.

                <br><br><span>TLDR:</span> Forecasts are randomized since this app serves to highlight my form abilities.
