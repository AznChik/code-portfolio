    You, Devon, are the luckiest twelve-year-old boy in the world because you just won two special VIP passes to Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex! An all-day, all-you-can-eat, all-expenses-paid experience for you and one of your best-\n
    "You're bringing Ike," Mom says, looking at the colorful printout in your hand that shows Glamrock Freddy pointing at you with the words YOU'RE A WINNER!\n
    "What? No! Moooooommmm..." you wail. You can't think of anything less fun than spending the whole day with the mobile snot factory that is your six-year-old brother.\n
    "Yes!" Ike shouts.\n
    "Did that sound like a question or a suggestion?" Mom crosses her arms. "Either you both go or no one goes."\n
    Poof! There goes your dream of being the most popular kid in your class, at least while everyone competes to be the one to join you at the Pizzaplex.\n
    "Fine." You sulk.\n
    You, Devon, are the unluckiest twelve-year-old boy in the world because you just won two special VIP passes to Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex... for you and your little brother.\n
    You have to waste one of your precious VIP passes on your brother, but this is still going to be so much fun. You can just ignore the tagalong like you usually do while you have the time of your life.\n
    Even though you live near the Pizzaplex, you hardly ever get to go. Your boring parents don't like the flashy lights and noise, and they say it's overpriced and the animatronics are "disconcerting," which you think means they don't like the Glamrock band's music. It's been ages since you were there last, at a classmate's birthday party, but it seems like the place gets bigger every year and they're always adding new rides.\n
    Ready Freddy?`,
