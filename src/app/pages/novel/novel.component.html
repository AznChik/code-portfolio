    <p>This serves as homage to Scott Cawthon, mastermind behind the FNAF (Five Nights at Freddy's) franchise,
        by bringing his first interactive novel to life. The source material for this is free on Kindle.</p>
    <p>I own none of this story's content and only claim how his words were brought to this digital reality.</p>
